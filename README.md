## Problem Statement

Design and implement an autonomous robotic goalkeeper that:

- Detects a moving ball using computer vision,  
- operates in real time under constraints, and sensor noise
- Uses feedback control (PID) to actuate a motorized platform to intercept the ball before it reaches the goal.
