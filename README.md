# RoboKeeper ⚽🤖
An autonomous tabletop robotic goalkeeper using computer vision and feedback control.

---

## Problem Statement

Design and implement an autonomous robotic goalkeeper that:

- Detects a moving ball using computer vision,  
- Estimates and predicts its trajectory in real time, and  
- Uses feedback control (PID) to actuate a motorized platform to intercept the ball before it reaches the goal.

The system must operate under real-time constraints, handle sensor noise and detection uncertainty, and achieve reliable interception rates.
